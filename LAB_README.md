## Feature Tasks  
For this assignment you will be building a HTTP server with a  main *server module* and separate module/s to parse a request's url and body. 

The application will use the [Cowsay](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cowsay) module.

The server module is responsible for creating an http server defining all route behavior and exporting an interface for starting and stoping the server. It should export an object with `start` and `stop` methods. The start and stop methods should each return a promise that resolves on success and rejects on error. 
###### GET /

When a client makes a GET request to / the server should send back html with a project description and a anchor to /cowsay.
``` html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title> cowsay </title>  
  </head>
  <body>
   <header>
     <nav>
       <ul> 
         <li><a href="/cowsay">cowsay</a></li>
       </ul>
     </nav>
   <header>
   <main>
     <!-- project description -->
   </main>
  </body>
</html>
```

###### GET /cowsay?text={message}

When a client makes a GET request to /cowsay?text={message} the server should parse the querystring for a text key. It should then send a rendered HTML page with a cowsay cow speaking the value of the text query. If their is no text query the cow message should say `'I need something good to say!'`. 
``` html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title> cowsay </title>  
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1> cowsay </h1>
    <pre>
      <!-- cowsay.say({text: req.query.text}) -->
    </pre>
  </body>
</html>
```

###### POST /api/cowsay
 
When a client makes a POST request to /api/cowsay it should send JSON that includes `{"text": "<message>"}`. The server should respond with a JSON body `{"content": "<cowsay cow>"}`.  

A response for a valid Requests should have a status code of 200 and the JSON body   
``` json 
{
  "content": "<cowsay cow text>" 
}
```

A response for a invalid Requests should have a status code of 400 and the JSON body...
```
{
  "error": "invalid request: text query required"
}
```



| Request | Response Status Code | Response Type | Response Body |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| With out a body | 400 | JSON | `{"error": "invalid request: body required"}` |
| With out text property on the body | 400 | JSON | `{"error": "invalid request: text query required"}` |
| With text query | 200 | JSON | `{"content": "<cowsay cow text>"}` |


## Bonus
**1pts:** add the ability to change the cowfile on GET /cowsay, GET /api/cowsay, and POST /api/cowsay - **ex: dragon, sheep, etc**
